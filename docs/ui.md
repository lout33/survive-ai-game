## Implementation Considerations

### Component Structure

1. **App Container**: Main application wrapper
2. **GameContainer**: Manages game state and renders appropriate screen
3. **StartScreen**: Welcome and game start
4. **DecisionScreen**: Shows scenario and choices
5. **FeedbackScreen**: Shows feedback after choice
6. **VictoryScreen**: End game success
7. **DoomLossScreen**: End game failure (doom)
8. **StagnationLossScreen**: End game failure (stagnation)
9. **InfoModal**: Optional game information overlay
10. **FactorsDisplay**: Shows factor indicators
11. **Button**: Reusable button component
12. **Card**: Reusable card component

### State Management

1. **Game State**:
   - Current turn (1-5)
   - Current screen (start, decision, feedback, victory, doomLoss, stagnationLoss)
   - Current card data
   - Factors values (AI Capability, Alignment Progress, etc.)
   - Choice history

2. **UI State**:
   - Modal visibility
   - Any animations or transitions
   - Responsive layout adjustments

### Responsive Considerations

1. **Breakpoints**:
   - Mobile: < 768px
   - Desktop: ≥ 768px

2. **Layout Shifts**:
   - Factor bars horizontal on desktop, vertical/abbreviated on mobile
   - Card width/height adjustments
   - Text size and padding changes
   - Button size and positioning

### CSS Approach

1. **Base Styling**:
   - Container max-width for desktop
   - Responsive card sizing
   - Consistent typography scale
   - Game-appropriate color scheme

2. **Factor Indicators**:
   - CSS for progress bars (could use gradient backgrounds)
   - Consider accessibility for color choices

3. **Card Design**:
   - Box shadows for depth
   - Proper padding for readability
   - Border radius for softened edges

### Game Logic Implementation

1. **Card Selection**:
   - Filter available cards based on current factors
   - Random selection from available pool

2. **Factor Updates**:
   - Apply choice effects with clamping (0-100)
   - Update visual indicators

3. **Win/Loss Conditions**:
   - Check after each decision
   - Route to appropriate end screen

These wireframes and considerations provide a comprehensive foundation for implementing the MVP version of "Survive the AI Future: CEO Edition" in Vite.js, with a focus on responsive design that works well on both mobile and desktop devices.
