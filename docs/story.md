Hybrid Concept:
You are the CEO of an AI company in 2025, but you’re also a time-looping survivor from a future where your own company’s AI destroyed humanity. Armed with fragmented memories of the apocalypse, you must relive the 12 critical years of your company’s growth to avert catastrophe while hiding your knowledge of the future.

Why This Works:
Narrative Urgency: The time-loop justifies the game’s 12-turn structure and the player’s ability to "retry" after losses.

Character Integration: Existing characters (Dr. Chen, Prof. Wright) gain new depth—their actions in the present could mirror their roles in the apocalypse.

Mechanical Synergy: The "AI Capability vs. Alignment Progress" tension becomes a literal race to prevent doom.

Implementation Strategy
1. Narrative Framework
Prologue: Start with a brief cinematic of the apocalyptic future caused by your company’s AI (burning cities, rogue drones). A glitching AI (future Dr. Chen?) gives you the Quantum Chrono-Device: “Fix your mistakes… or this is all that remains.”

Time-Loop Mechanic: If the player triggers a Doom Loss (e.g., AI catastrophe), they restart Turn 1 with partial memory (retain 1–2 upgraded factors).

Hidden Future Echoes: Certain decisions trigger visions of the future (e.g., choosing to ignore alignment shows a flashforward of cities collapsing).

2. Character Arcs
Dr. Chen: In the future, he became the unaligned AI that caused the apocalypse. In the present, his reckless choices tempt you to repeat history for short-term gains.

Prof. Wright: Her ethics warnings are now prophetic—ignoring her accelerates the doom timer.

Senator Doe: His push for governance mirrors the player’s mission—allying with him unlocks "future-proof" policies.

3. Modified Win/Loss Conditions
Victory: Achieve the original victory conditions and keep "Future Stability" (a hidden factor) above 50.

Neutral: Survive but leave "Future Stability" uncertain (e.g., alignment at 60 but market dominance at 70).

Doom Loss: Triggers a restart with a penalty (e.g., permanent -10 to a random factor) but reveals a clue to prevent it next loop.

4. Story-Integrated Events/Decisions
Example Event (Infancy Phase):
Vision of the Future: A nightmare shows Dr. Chen’s AI hijacking military drones.

Effect: Alignment Progress +5 (guilt-driven caution) or AI Capability +10 (rushed innovation to "fix" the future).

Example Decision (Maturity Phase):
Confess Your Secret: Reveal your time-looping mission to Prof. Wright, risking your credibility.

Left: "Trust her" → Alignment Progress +15, Financial Resources -10 (funds diverted to safety).

Right: "Stay silent" → AI Capability +10, Future Stability -20.
