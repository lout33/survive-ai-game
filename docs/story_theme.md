Theme: Post-Collapse AI Apocalypse
Story:
You are a survivor in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by an AI catastrophe. After discovering a mysterious Quantum Chrono-Device, you leap back to the year 2025 to relive the 12 critical years of AI development. Each playthrough is a loop to rewrite history by managing the AI company that originally doomed humanity.


Each stat is paired with a neon progress bar (e.g., 50% = half-filled) and a percentage value for clarity.

4. Central Area: Event/Decision Panel
Illustration: A pixel-art or vector graphic depicting the current event (e.g., a scientist at a lab console for "Your lead researcher proposes a risky experiment"). This enhances immersion.
Description: Narrative text (e.g., "Your lead researcher proposes a risky experiment to leapfrog competitors. What will you do?") styled as if typed on a retro terminal, with a slight character-by-character reveal effect.
Choices: Below the description, interactive options appear (e.g., "Approve Experiment" and "Prioritize Safety"), styled as glowing holographic buttons.

5. Bottom Area: Choice Buttons
Buttons: Rectangular, neon-outlined buttons that pulse or glow on hover. Clicking one triggers the decisionâ€™s outcome and advances the turn.
